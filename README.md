# Todo App (Laravel)

When I was learning laravel, this is my training repository, because this, it's not only a todo app, and have so much code.

## Route /todo
This is the route that you can acess to see the todo app, with this you can acess a crud of todos and you can see how is

## Route /config
By this route, is a login system that was maden and use some the laravel's features of authentication.

## Others Routes
All the outher routes I just use to train, because, like I just said, this is the repository that I use when I was learning laravel
